# 404-error-page-for-today
Pro tip: Even if a site doesn’t have an error page, you can see the error codes for yourself in your browser. In Chrome, for example, right-click on the page and hit “inspect.” You’ll see the set of developer tool panels. In the tab labeled “Console” you’ll see a list of any HTTP response codes that may be getting generated, along with a bunch of other “under the hood” info the server is telling your browser.

Fun fact: A little-known Error 451 code exists and is sometimes used. The code is meant to be used when access is denied due to legal request, and is a reference to the dystopian novel “Fahrenheit 451.”

What is a 404 error page?
A 404 error page is a web page designated to be displayed when a request triggers the HTTP 404 response code. This code means the client (or, “visitor”) was able to locate the server, but not the specific destination. In other words, they found your site, but not a specific page within your site. So the server sends your browser a 404 response code, letting them know what happened. If the site’s designer designated one, a 404 error page is loaded.

There are two common reasons a visitor might land on an error page:
They hit a link that points to a URL for a page that no longer exists
They click or type a misspelled link
The effect of “link rot” is a byproduct of the first reason, old links. Websites are regularly updated, moved, or deleted. But no one person can fully control, or know, the network of external properties linking to their page. This means that although the links live on, they point to a page that no longer exists. Thus, link rot. It’s so widespread that half of the links cited in Supreme Court opinions no longer host the original content, according to one estimate.

Since we can’t control who might be sending visitors to dead links on our domain, the next best thing we can do is have a great 404 error page set up. Even though sending visitors to an error page isn’t an ideal experience, it’s still an experience you can own.
